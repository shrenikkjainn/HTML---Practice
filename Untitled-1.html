        <h2>About Eco-Friendly Fuels</h2>
        <p>Eco-friendly fuels, also known as alternative or renewable fuels, are sources of energy that are considered more environmentally sustainable and less harmful to the planet compared to traditional fossil fuels. These fuels are crucial in the fight against climate change and reducing the environmental impact of energy production and consumption.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The serious concerns of the global climate change, the rising trend of environmental pollution among others have necessitated researchers and industries to develop renewable alternative and cleaner energies across the world. The need for alternative and sustainable energy sources also arises from the global rise in population and the consequent increase in energy demand even as industrialization keeps on expanding. Therefore, the need to drive the world with efficient and eco-friendly energy carriers is paramount. Biofuels are one of the renewable, sustainable sources of energy carriers that can drive the modern day world with the high prospect and potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This reduction in this greenhouse gas emission will certainly be in line with Kyoto Protocol. Yet, no fuel system is completely free of environmental concerns [6]. The high dependency and pressure on finite fossil fuels will be shifted due to the global call to look into renewable eco-friendly fuel carriers.

            <br>The key sectors that need to be driven by efficient and cleaner fuel substitutes are the aviation, transportation and the manufacturing industries. Over the last two decades, a number of biofuels have been developed. These include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, synthetic fuel, hydrogen and so on. Most of these fuels can be blended or used directly in internal combustion engine (ICE) [7, 8]. The cost of production of some these fuels is still relatively on the high side even despite the fact that they have lower environmental consequences when compared with fossil fuel. The various production methodologies could be responsible for the high cost of these biofuels [9]. Syntheses like fermentation, alcoholysis, Saccharification, acidolysis, hydrolysis, esterification, gasification, liquefaction and extraction have been used to produce biofuels.
            <br>   
            <br>The combustion of hydrocarbon fuel with O2 from the atmosphere gives equivalent amount of CO2 and H2O. The other discharges are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO, N2O) and nitrogen compounds (NH3 and HCN), sulfur gases (SO2, CS2, OCS), compounds of halogens and carbons (CH3Br and CHCl). Combustion of these finite fossil fuels and other biomass led to the global alteration in the atmosphere with respect to huge emissions discharges from these two main contributors [10]. Combustion from automobile, stationary sources are largely responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions to date (through CO2, stratospheric O3, and soot) and also some opposing effects (through SO2). It has had minimal effect on stratospheric O3 (through CH3Cl, CH3Br, CH4) but has likely influenced the stratospheric oxidant levels (through CO, NOx, NMHC), specifically the Northern Hemisphere [10]. Even though energy is key to drive the daily and economic activities but it should not be to the detriment of humanity.
            <br>   
            <br>Bioethanol, biogas and biodiesel are the most widely used biofuels. Bioethanol production is very high in Brazil and USA due to large volume of production of sugar cane and corn respectively. Research is also directed to the use of cellulose to produce ethanol [11]. Cellulose is converted to sugar and thereafter to ethanol. However, biodiesel is common in the Scandinavian countries and Germany in Europe. Biodiesel is usually blended using about 5–20% in these countries [12]. Germany is one of the top countries known for the production of biodiesel. Biogas on the other hand is usually produced from animal waste. The leading countries in the production of biogas in Europe are Germany and Great Britain. As the production of biofuel is gaining interest, bio-refineries are being cited in advanced countries like the USA, Germany to produce biofuels and other associated products.
            <br>  
            <br>Gasification of biomass to produce methanol, ethanol, dimethylether, syn-diesel could also result in the production of hydrogen and methane which may be used in vehicles. Largely, all these conversion processes are still relatively high in cost.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Eco-Friendly Fuels</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</b> One of the primary reasons for the development and adoption of eco-friendly fuels is their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, release carbon dioxide and other pollutants when burned, contributing to global warming and air pollution. Eco-friendly fuels, on the other hand, produce fewer or no harmful emissions during their use.</li>
            <li><b>Diverse Sources:</b> Eco-friendly fuels are derived from a wide range of sources, including renewable energy, organic matter, and even waste products. Some common examples include biofuels (made from crops and organic waste), solar energy (captured from the sun), wind energy (harnessed from the wind), and hydrogen fuel cells (using hydrogen as a clean energy source).</li>
            <li><b>Renewable and Sustainable:</b> Many eco-friendly fuels are renewable, meaning they can be continuously produced without depleting finite resources. For example, solar and wind energy are inexhaustible and don't rely on fossil fuels. This makes them sustainable choices for the long term.</li>
            <li><b>Improved Air Quality:</b> The use of eco-friendly fuels in vehicles and power generation can lead to improved air quality. These fuels produce fewer pollutants and particulate matter, leading to cleaner and healthier urban environments.</li>
            <li><b>Reduced Dependence on Fossil Fuels:</b> By transitioning to eco-friendly fuels, societies can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, which are finite and subject to price fluctuations. This can enhance energy security and reduce the impact of energy price volatility.</li>
            <li><b>Government Incentives:</b> Many governments around the world offer incentives and subsidies to encourage the use of eco-friendly fuels. These incentives may include tax benefits, grants, and rebates to make these energy sources more accessible and affordable.</li>

        <p>Biodiesel is a domestically produced, clean-burning, renewable substitute for petroleum diesel. Using biodiesel as a vehicle fuel increases energy security, improves air quality and the environment, and provides safety benefits.</p>
        <p>Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel derived from plants or animals and consisting of long-chain fatty acid esters. It is typically made by chemically reacting lipids such as animal fat (tallow),[1] soybean oil,[2] or some other vegetable oil[3] with an alcohol, producing a methyl, ethyl or propyl ester by the process of transesterification.</p>
          <p>Unlike the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines, biodiesel is a drop-in biofuel, meaning it is compatible with existing diesel engines and distribution infrastructure. However, it is usually blended with petrodiesel (typically to less than 10%) since most engines cannot run on pure biodiesel without modification.[4][5] Biodiesel blends can also be used as heating oil.</p>

            <p>Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH3CH2OH. It is an alcohol, with its formula also written as C2H5OH, C2H6O or EtOH, where Et stands for ethyl. Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a characteristic wine-like odor and pungent taste.[11][12] It is a psychoactive recreational drug, and the active ingredient in alcoholic drinks.</p>
            <p>Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation process of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes such as ethylene hydration. Historically it was used as a general anesthetic, and has modern medical applications as an antiseptic, disinfectant, solvent for some medications, and antidote for methanol poisoning and ethylene glycol poisoning.[13][14] It is used as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds, and as a fuel source. Ethanol also can be dehydrated to make ethylene, an important chemical feedstock. As of 2006, world production of ethanol was 51 gigalitres (1.3×1010 US gallons), coming mostly from Brazil and the U.S.[15]</p>

                <p>Hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The hydrogen reacts with oxygen across an electrochemical cell— similar to a battery—to produce electricity, water, and small amounts of heat.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen fuel cells are currently used to power the electrical systems on spacecraft and to supply electricity on earth. Small fuel cells have been developed to power electronic devices, such as laptop computers and cell phones. Several vehicle manufacturers have developed fuel cells to power vehicles. Fuel cells can potentially provide electricity for emergency power in buildings and for remote locations that are not connected to electric power grids.</p>

                    <p>Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating), and solar architecture.[1][2] It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.</p>

                        <p>Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work. Historically, wind power was used by sails, windmills and windpumps, but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation. Today, wind power is generated almost completely with wind turbines, generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid.</p>
                        <p>In 2022, wind supplied over 2000 TWh of electricity, which was over 7% of world electricity[1]: 58  and about 2% of world energy.[2][3] With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW.[4][3][5] To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, analysts say it should expand much faster - by over 1% of electricity generation per year.[6]</p>
                        <p>Wind power is considered a sustainable, renewable energy source, and has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels. Wind power is variable, so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity. Land-based (onshore) wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced.[7][8] Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors, although they are generally more expensive.[4] Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations.[9]</p>

                        <h2>DI-METHYL ETHER</h2>
                            <img width="350px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dimethyl_ether_3D_ball.png" alt="biodisesal">
                            <p>Dimethyl ether (DME) is a synthetically produced alternative to diesel for use in specially designed compression ignition diesel engines. Under normal atmospheric conditions, DME is a colorless gas. It is used extensively in the chemical industry and as an aerosol propellant. Dimethyl ether requires about 75 pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure to be in liquid form. Because of this, DME's handling requirements are similar to those of propane—both must be kept in pressurized storage tanks at an ambient temperature.</p>
                            <p>The use of DME in vehicles requires a compression ignition engine with a fuel system specifically developed to operate on DME. A number of DME vehicle demonstrations have been held in Europe and North America, including one in which a customer operated 10 vehicles for 750,000 miles.</p>
                            <p>Although DME can be produced from biomass, methanol, and fossil fuels, the likely feedstock of choice for large-scale DME production in the United States is natural gas. DME can be produced directly from synthesis gas produced from natural gas, coal, or biomass. It can also be produced indirectly from methanol via a dehydration reaction. DME is not commercially available in the United States.</p>
